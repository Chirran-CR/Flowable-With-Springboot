# Flowable Spring Boot Application

This repository contains a Spring Boot application integrated with Flowable BPMN engine. The application demonstrates the use of Call Activities within Flowable processes and provides REST API endpoints to create, deploy, and complete tasks.

## Features

- **Flowable BPMN Engine Integration**: Leveraging Flowable for business process management and workflow automation.
- **Call Activity**: Demonstrates the use of Call Activity to invoke subprocesses within the main process.
- **REST API Endpoints**: Provides endpoints to interact with Flowable processes, including creating, deploying, and completing tasks.
- **Spring Boot**: Utilizes Spring Boot to simplify setup and configuration, making the application easy to run and maintain.

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6.0 or higher
- Spring Boot 2.5.0 or higher
- Flowable 6.6.0 or higher

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flowable-springboot-callactivity.git
cd flowable-springboot-callactivity
Build and Run
Use Maven to build and run the application:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
API Endpoints
The application exposes several REST API endpoints to interact with Flowable processes:

Create Process: Start a new process instance.

http
Copy code
POST /api/process/start
Request Body: JSON containing the process definition key and initial variables.
Deploy Process: Deploy a BPMN process definition.

http
Copy code
POST /api/process/deploy
Request Body: JSON containing the BPMN XML or file path.
Complete Task: Complete a user task with provided variables.

http
Copy code
POST /api/task/complete
Request Body: JSON containing the task ID and variables to complete the task.
Example Request
http
Copy code
POST /api/task/complete
{
    "taskId": "12345",
    "variables": {
        "loanAmount": 10000,
        "accountBalance": 5000
    }
}
Key Components
Flowable Configuration: Configured to integrate with Flowable for managing process definitions and instances.
Service Tasks: Demonstrates the use of JavaDelegate to handle service tasks within processes.
Call Activities: Shows how to invoke subprocesses using Call Activity, allowing modular and reusable process components.
Process Diagrams
The repository includes BPMN diagrams illustrating the main process and subprocesses. These diagrams demonstrate the flow of tasks and decision points, with Call Activities linking to subprocesses.

Main Process Example

Subprocess Example

Usage Scenarios
Loan Approval Workflow: A simple workflow demonstrating a loan approval process where subprocesses handle different stages such as eligibility check and document verification.
Task Automation: Example of automating repetitive tasks through Flowable processes with REST API integration for task management.
